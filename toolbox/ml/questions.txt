What is the general trend in the curve? 
Generally, the higher the percentage of data used for training, the higher the accuracy (seems to be linear).

Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why? 
The whole curve appears to be rather noisy with 10 trials. The accuracy of lower training percentages varies a lot, because the small amount of training data may or may not be enough to accurately train the classifier.

How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve? 
At between 100 and 1000 trials the curve definitely shows an upward trend, but the curve isn't necessarily super smooth. Above 1000 trials, the curve begins to really smooth out.

Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)). What happens? If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
A smaller C value causes the accuracy to vary a lot within a small margin. A larger C value causes the trend in the accuracy to be clear and smooths out the curve, but also causes there to be a much larger accuracy range.
